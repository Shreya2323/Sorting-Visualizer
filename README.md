# Sorting-Visualizer

This is a simple Sorting Visualizer project made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
---

Why I built this

I built this project because:
- I found it difficult to visualize sorting algorithms
- Dry theory and code were confusing for me
- Visual movement helped me understand comparisons, swaps, and iterations
- This project made sorting logic much easier for me

---

What this project does

- Shows the original array and keeps it unchanged
- Shows the sorted array separately
- Visualizes Bubble Sort and Selection Sort
- Bars move while sorting so you can see comparisons and swaps
- The current comparing elements glow
- Sorting speed can be controlled using a slider
- The exact line of code being executed is highlighted
- Step-by-step logs explain what is happening

---

Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
No external libraries are used.

---

Sorting Algorithms Included

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
Both are implemented in a beginner-friendly way so the logic is easy to follow.

---

Who this project is for

- Students learning DSA
- Beginners who struggle with sorting concepts
- Anyone who wants to see how sorting works instead of just reading code

---

How to run the project

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open index.html in a browser
3. Select a sorting algorithm
4. Adjust speed if needed
5. Click Start and watch the sorting happen

---

What I learned from this project

- How sorting algorithms work internally
- How animations and delays help in understanding algorithms better

---

Future improvements

- Add more sorting algorithms
- Add pause and resume option
- Allow custom array input
